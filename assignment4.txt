1. Characteristics of Big data in detail 


     The 5 different characterisitcs of big data are 

   * VOLUME   : The amount of data stored or generated .It is measured in Zettabytes , gigabytes . 

   * VARIETY  : It is the type and nature of data .It can be structured ,unstructured , semi structured .
 
   * VELOCITY : The speed at which the data is generated or stored  . 

   * VERACITY : It refers to the trustworthiness of the data in terms of accuracy .
 
   * VALUE    : Big data is effective only when we can convert it to the value . 




2. Explain the possible solutions to handle Big Data 
   
  The possible solutions of big data are

  * Scale up  : Refers to adding more processor . It is to increase the data transfer speed and disk capacity . It is complex                 and costly .It is time consuming . 
 
  * Scale out : Use multiple commodity machines and distribute the load among them . It is quick in implementing and is cost                 efficient . It focuses on distribution of load . 





3. Difference between scaling up and scaling out

  * Scaling up  : Refers to adding more processor . It is to increase the data transfer speed and disk capacity . It is                   complex and costly .It is time consuming . 
 
  * Scaling out : Use multiple commodity machines and distribute the load among them . It is quick in implementing and is                   cost efficient . It focuses on distribution of load .
